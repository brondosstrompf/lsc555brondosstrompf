</h2>



<h2>
System Introduction</h2>

<h3>
Context</h3>

<p>HathiTrust is an organization and digital library that was started in 2008 as a collaboration of the “Committee on Institutional Cooperation,” comprising twelve U.S. universities (now known as the “Big Ten Academic Alliance”), and the eleven University of California libraries.  Current HathiTrust membership extends to over 200 research libraries including international institutions. HathiTrust works to build its digital collection of archived items from member libraries as well as preserve these materials and make them available to all users.</p>

<h3>
Users</h3>

<p>The system is targeted primarily for “researchers and scholars,” while also providing a service to the public. In addition, the organization focuses on accessibility to users with “print disabilities.”  (https://www.hathitrust.org/about/mission-history/)
Member libraries digitized the majority of the collection's materials from print using Google.</p>

<h3>
Content</h3>

<p>
Search results can be extensive, and drop-down filters offer options to narrow or broaden a search by related subject, author, language, place and/or date of publication, original format and/or location. Each catalog record is comprehensive and includes the book title, author, publication date and location, number of pages, print version location if available, and a citation tool. <br>

The types of resources in the collection include
Books, periodicals, sheet music, journals, govt docs, "born digital" materials, primary sources; "no audio/visual files" are available.</br>

The system houses more than 18 million items in over 400 languages, including ancient and extinct languages.</p>


<h2>
Discussion of the System </h2>

<h3>
Interesting Features</h3>

<p>This is a complex system with many search layers, starting with basic keywords search or advanced boolean terms search to the additional, specific search features of the drop-down filters. An advanced search also allows for addition of "wildcards" symbols to hone the search.</p>


<h3>
Pros & Cons of the System</h3>

<h4>
Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>All users can read public domain and open access materials in the system
all users can create a login that allows them to save sources
search bar on all pages of site</li>
<li>tools in "Research Center" available to run data analytics on the collection. https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/search-access/#hathitrust-access-basics</li>
<li>"Get Help" at the top of every page -- select "Find Help" and search for topic in the search bar, generates a list of "Self-help resources" and links within the website to the information. Select "Ask a Question," a form pops up to fill out in order to create a ticket; library worker will answer question via email.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only 40% of collection can be accessed by guests, i.e. users not affiliated with a library that has a HathiTrust membership (i.e. "member library") https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/search-access/</li>
<li>for blind or print disabled user, materials only accessible through member library</li>
<li>search does not allow NOT boolean term to help narrow results</li>
<li>Using my CUA affiliation, initial attempts to search keywords using the basic search bar would not allow a search of the Website only and not the Collection, despite offering the drop down option for the Collection. was only able to toggle to Collection after initially engaging in an advanced search. As a Guest, the basic search of Collection was functional.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Suggestions for Improvement</h3>

<ul>
<li>Troubleshoot/test for system compatibility</li>
<li>Include option for NOT boolean term in advanced search</li>
</ul>
