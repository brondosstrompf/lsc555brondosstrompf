<h2>
System Introduction</h2>

<h3>
Context</h3>

<p>HathiTrust is an organization and digital library founded in 2008 as a collaboration between the “Committee on Institutional Cooperation”--comprising twelve U.S. universities now known as the “Big Ten Academic Alliance”--and the eleven University of California libraries. Current HathiTrust membership extends to over 200 research libraries including international institutions. HathiTrust works to build its digital collection of archived items from member libraries as well as preserve these materials and make them available to all users.</p>

<h3>
Users</h3>

<p>The system is primarily for researchers and scholars, but it is also open to the public. In addition, it provides accessibility for users with “print disabilities.” Member libraries have digitized the majority of the collection's materials from print using Google.</p>

<h3>
Content</h3>

<p>
Materials in the Collection encompass a broad range of topics. Search results can be extensive, and drop-down filters offer options to narrow or broaden a search by related subject, author, language, place of publication, date of publication, original format, and original location. Each catalog record is comprehensive and includes all of the categories in the search results as well as the source title, number of pages, print version location(s) if available, and a citation tool. </p>
<p>
The types of resources in the collection include books, periodicals, sheet music, journals, government documents, "born digital" materials, and primary sources; audio/visual files are not available.</p>
<p>
The system houses more than 18 million items in over 400 languages, including ancient and extinct languages.</p>


<h2>
Discussion of the System </h2>

<h3>
Interesting Features</h3>

<p>This is a complex system with many search layers; a basic keywords search or an advanced boolean terms search are just starting points. From there, a user can explore multiple additional, specific search features using the drop-down filters. An advanced search also allows for addition of "wildcards" symbols to hone the search.</p>


<h3>
Pros & Cons of the System</h3>

<h3 style="font-style: normal;">
Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>All users can read public domain and open access materials in the system.</li>
<li>All users can create a login which allows them to save sources.</li>
<li>In the "Research Center," a tool is available to run data analytics on the Collection.</li>
<li>There is a "Get Help" drop-down menu at the top of every page. From there, a user can select "Find Help" and search for a topic in the search bar, which generates a list of "Self-help resources" and links to the information within the website. Alternatively, a user can select "Ask a Question," and a form pops up to fill out in order to create an inquiry ticket; a library worker will then answer the question via email.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-style: normal;">
Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only 40 percent of the collection can be accessed by guests, i.e. users not affiliated with a member library.</li>
<li>For a blind or print disabled user, materials are only accessible through a member library.</li>
<li>The boolean search does not provide "NOT" as a term to help narrow results.</li>
<li>Using my CUA affiliation, initial attempts to search keywords using the basic search bar allowed a search of the Website only and not the Collection, despite offering the drop- down option for the Collection. I was only able to toggle to the Collection after initially engaging in an advanced search. As a Guest, the basic search of the Collection was functional. As a result, my experience as a guest initially was better than my experience as a member library affiliate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Suggestions for Improvement</h3>

<ul>
<li>The IT team should troubleshoot and test for system compatibility with member institution logins.</li>
<li>The advanced search option should include the boolean term "NOT".</li>
</ul>
