<h2>
Heuristic Review of the System</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Search Topic: Changing Attitudes Toward Diversity</h4>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
1. Visibility of system status</h4>
<ul>
<li>A circular status alert appears on the page and page tab when waiting for search results or another page to load.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
2. Match between system and the real world</h4>
<ul>
<li>The skeumorphic design of the home page helps the user to quickly become familiar with how the website generally functions.</li>   
<li>Menu labels for sections of the newspaper match other newspapers—e.g. News, Sports, Politics.</li>
  <li>A keyword(s) search produces a page entitled “Search Results for: keyword(s)” and relevant articles are linked below the title, similar to other search engines.
	<ul>
	  <li>A search for "diversity, equity, and inclusion" returns articles from the Politics, Quill, and News sections. The top result is a 2021 article on the appointment of Associate Dean Williams to oversee DEI initiatives on campus.</li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
3. User control and freedom</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The standard back arrow in the browser bar generally allows the user to go back to a previously viewed page.
	<ul>
	  <li>The back arrow functions inconsistently. A search using the keyword "diversity" preceded a search of "LGBTQ." An attempt to backtrack just repeated the results for "LGBTQ", while the search bar reverted to the initial search term, "diversity."</li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are two options to go “home”: click on "THE TOWER" title at the top of every page, or click on “Home/” on a search-results page.</li>
  <li>If the newspaper sections or search results span multiple pages, the user can view additional pages by selecting a page number, “Previous,” or “Next” at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ul>


<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
4. Consistency and standards</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The homepage, newpaper sections, and search results text is consistently in the same sans-serif font, with black text on white or gray background and white text on black or red background.
	<ul>
	  <li>However, the bottom portion of every page, where the top five "Recent Posts" and "Archives" articles are linked, deviates from the internal design convention. This portion of the site displays white text on a deep blue background.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consistent with other search engines, a keyword(s) search produces articles containing the keyword(s) on a page entitled “Search Results for: keyword(s)” with relevant articles linked below the titles.
	<ul>
	  <li>A search of the keyword "diversity" returns multiple pages of articles from the "Politics," "Quill," and "News" sections.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Following website conventions, the results appear from most to least relevant to the search term. 
	<ul>
	  <li>The top result for "diversity" is a 2021 article on the appointment of Associate Dean Williams to oversee DEI initiatives on campus, an article highly relevant to the search term.</li>
  	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>The website follows industry and internal standards by providing the “home” links, newspaper sections links, and a search option throughout the site, at the top of every page.</li>
  <li>Links to other pages and sources are embedded in the text in blue font and underlined, per the industry standard.</li>
</ul>


<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
5. Error prevention</h4>
<ul>
<li>No guidance, such as confirmation messages or specific instructions, is provided to prevent the user from making errors.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
6. Recognition rather than recall</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The system exhibits limited capability of helping users with recognition. When the user types a single letter into the search bar, the system displays a list of the user's previously searched keywords that begin with that letter. While the user does not have to rely entirely on their memory of past searches, the system is impractical. It requires a user to enter initial letters one at a time to prompt the system to show previous search terms, and then the user must repeat the same steps for every letter.</li>
  <li>The newspaper section headings repeat on every page, as do the links to monthly editions of the paper, providing easy navigation to the different sections of the newspaper.</li>
  <li> In the "Archives" list of newspaper editions, a user might assume that the number under each listed edition represents the number of articles included in it, but no additional info or link is associated with the number to provide guidance.</li>
</ul>


<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</h4>
<ul>
  <li>When scrolling down through search results or newspaper sections, an up arrow appears as a shortcut option to return to the top of page.</li>
  <li>For quick access to featured topics, activities, or actions--such as "News," "Quizzes," or "Subscribe"--the user can click on one of the headings that repeats on every page.</li>
  <li>The search bar accommodates different levels of user interaction. A user can perform a basic keyword search. In addition, a user can include quotes around search terms as well as enter the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT. However, the site does not guide the user to employ such advanced search tools, thus requiring a user not only to already be familiar with these operators, but also to randomly try various search tools in order to determine which ones function in the system. 
	<ul>
	  <li>A search for “diversity, equity, and inclusion” in quotes returns three articles that all contain the full search phrase.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The number of search results shown on a page is limited to a maximum of ten, contributing to an overall minimalist aesthetic.</li>
  <li>Search results are returned in a simple and consistent format, with each headline clearly displayed below a photo image.</li>
  <li>On the homepage, under the "What's New" heading, the user can view four out of five articles at a time via a vertically sliding feature. Each article is labeled with a number that adds no value to the feature</li>
  <li>While the most prominant information is presented in a simple format, a large amount of seemingly irrelevant information is also included; the "Archives" section that appears on the right side of every page adds "noise" to the layout. The "Archives" comprises a lengthy list of monthly editions dating back to 2015. The list can be distracting and misleading to a user researching specific information.
	<ul>
	  <li>A numeral appears under each monthly edition. Presumably this indicates the number of articles in the edition; however, no explanation is provided.</li>
	  <li>The "Archives" list repeats at the bottom of every page, further adding to the "noise."</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  
<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>When a user enters a misspelled keyword, for example “diversitie,” in the search box, the system returns the message, “Nothing Found: Sorry, but nothing matched your search terms. Please try again with some different keywords.” This provides specific feedback that helps the user identify their error.</li>
  <li>The site fails to provide instructions regarding search options, so the user is forced to resort to trial and error to determine what features of an advanced search will function. However, when conducting an advanced search, the Wildcard asterisk and parentheses separately return the “Nothing Found...” message, thus indicating to the user that those features are inoperable within the system. </li>
</ul>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
10. Help and documentation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>No "Help" feature or self-training documents are offered, leaving the user to decipher the system on their own. The system lacks features such as tooltips, help videos, chat options, and popovers that would facilitate site navigation.</li>
  <li>There is neither an FAQs section nor an obvious way to contact someone at the newspaper with questions or to request information. The user is able to locate an editor's contact information only by exploring the site. 
	<ul>
	  <li>By hovering over the "About" section heading and selecting “Meet the Staff,” a user is able to see the editorial staff and their email addresses.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
Strengths & Weaknesses of the System</h2>

<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
Top 2 Strengths</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Search bar:  The keyword search on the site follows standard conventions. The search function is easily identified by the magnifying glass icon on the homepage and a labeled bar on all other pages.</li>
  <li>Presentation of articles: Articles returned from a search are presented in a minimalist style and easily navigable. Each result is clearly displayed with the article title and a corresponding photo; both the title and photo are linked to the full text.</li>
</ol>

<img src="Search Results.png" alt="Search Results" style="width:600px; height:390px;">


<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">
Top 2 Weaknesses</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Limited advanced search options: The search features that appear to work are AND, OR, NOT, and quotes. Options to narrow a search with parentheses, by date range, or within a particular section or edition, for example, are not available. Additional search options would have been particularly helpful in locating specific articles reflecting the changing attitudes toward diversity on campus. Browsing is the only other option for finding articles.</li>
  <li>Redundancy and awkward use of space: The archived editions by month and year comprise a lengthy list extending down the page. The same list is repeated in the dark blue section at the bottom of the page. There is no apparent difference between the lists. With both lists, there is no search feature to locate specific information within a selected edition.</li>
</ol>

<img src="Archives Lists.png" alt="Archives Lists" style="width:400px; height:400px;">


<h2>
Brief Comparison of Heuristic Analysis & Mini-Usability Test</h2>

<p>The heuristic analysis and the mini-usability test indicated that the presentation of information is consistent throughout the site as well as with other web sites. In both cases, the site design aesthetically appealed to the user, and the search option was easily identifiable. However, both the heuristic analysis and mini-usability test highlighted the limited searchability of the system, particularly when trying to hone a search for specific research material. In the usability test, the test subject struggled to locate interesting stories during their exploration of the site, observing “pretty light material...” In the heuristic analysis, the focused search produced more substantial but not always relevant articles. The mini-usability test revealed a lack of consistency in availability of PDF versions of newspaper, while in the heuristic analysis, the option to view the PDF version was not investigated.</p>

<p>
Two key improvements are recommended for the system. First, the “noise” of the lengthy and redundant "Archives" lists should be eliminated. In addition to adding clutter to the site design, they add to the user’s frustration with locating material; the user is limited to browsing and is unable to perform a search specifically within the "Archives." Second, a more sophisticated search function that includes Wildcards and filters--for dates in particular--would facilitate flexible, efficient, and more satisfying searches. The search options need to be clearly displayed and accompanied by instructions for the user. In the context of a student or professor conducting research, the current system essentially leaves the user on their own to hunt for information, creating an experience more akin to reading a digitized newspaper rather than exploring a source with interactive tools.</p>
